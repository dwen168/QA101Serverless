# Skill: portfolio-optimization

## Purpose
Transform a basket of stocks into an actionable portfolio recommendation. Rank stocks by multi-factor scores, visualize sector rotation opportunities, compute pair-wise correlations, and suggest optimal weighting based on risk/return profiles.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Collect Stock Market Data
Input: Array of tickers, optionally pre-computed MarketIntelligenceReport objects.
- If `useMarketData` provided: validate and use existing data
- Else: fetch market data for each ticker via market-intelligence skill (run in parallel)
- Return early with error if any ticker fails validation or critical API calls fail

### Step 2 — Compute Multi-Factor Score for Each Stock

For each ticker, calculate:

#### 2a. Momentum Score (0–100)
```
momentum = (price_change_1d% + price_change_5d% + price_change_1m%) / 3
slope = (current_price - ma50) / ma50 * 100
momentumScore = min(100, max(0, 50 + slope + momentum))
```

#### 2b. Quality Score (0–100)
```
qualityScore = 0
if pe > 0 and pe < 30: qualityScore += 25        (valuation not extended)
if eps > 0 and eps_growth_positive: qualityScore += 25   (earnings positive)
if sentiment_score > 0: qualityScore += 25       (positive sentiment)
if analyst_upside > 10%: qualityScore += 25      (consensus price target support)
```

#### 2c. Risk-Adjusted Score (0–100)
```
volatilityRank = (stock_vol - min_vol) / (max_vol - min_vol) * 100
riskScore = 100 - volatilityRank
if rsi > 70: riskScore -= 15  (overbought)
if rsi < 30: riskScore += 10  (oversold contrarian)
riskAdjustedScore = max(0, min(100, riskScore))
```

#### 2d. Composite Multi-Factor Score
```
compositeScore = (
  momentumScore * 0.30 +
  qualityScore * 0.40 +
  riskAdjustedScore * 0.30
)
// Weighted: quality > momentum > risk
```

### Step 3 — Compute Correlation Matrix
From price history of all tickers (30-day, if available):
- Log-return each stock's daily prices
- Compute Pearson correlation coefficient for each pair
- Return NxN matrix (N = number of tickers)
- Identify high-correlation pairs (> 0.75) and low-correlation pairs (< 0.3) for diversification insight

### Step 4 — Group by Sector & Identify Rotation Opportunity
- Map each ticker to its sector (from market-intelligence data)
- Group tickers by sector
- For each sector, compute aggregate:
  - Average sentiment score
  - Average momentum
  - Average quality
  - Sector strength score (0–100)
- Identify best-performing sector(s) vs. worst-performing

### Step 5 — Rank and Action Assignment
Sort tickers by composite score (descending).
Assign action based on score and market conditions:

| Score Range | Action | Allocation |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| ≥ 75 | STRONG BUY | 8–10% per position |
| 60–74 | BUY | 5–7% per position |
| 45–59 | HOLD | 3–5% per position |
| 30–44 | REDUCE | 1–3% per position |
| < 30 | SELL | 0% (exit) |

Allocations should sum to ≤ 100% (allow cash buffer).

### Step 6 — Diversification Metrics
Compute:
- **Correlation-weighted concentration**: sum of (allocation[i] × allocation[j] × corr[i,j]) for all i,j
- **Sector concentration**: largest sector % of total allocation
- **Idiosyncratic risk**: average pairwise correlation (lower is better)

### Step 7 — LLM Narrative
Send to LLM:
- Ranked ticker list + scores
- Top sector opportunity + reason
- Diversification summary
- Risk warnings

Request JSON output:
- `executiveSummary` — 1–2 sentences on portfolio thesis
- `sectorRotationInsight` — Which sectors are rotating in/out and why
- `diversificationAssessment` — Are we sufficiently diversified? Any concentration risks?
- `recommendations` — Plain-English actionable steps (e.g., "Overweight tech momentum, underweight utilities")
- `riskWarnings` — Array of portfolio-level risks (e.g., "High correlation to tech sector", "All picks are momentum-heavy")

## Notes
- **Correlation matrix computation**: Use daily log returns over 30-day window (if available). Handle missing data gracefully (NaN → 0 correlation).
- **Fallback factors**: If market data incomplete, use available fields and note lowered confidence.
- **Time horizon**: SHORT horizon emphasizes momentum + quality; MEDIUM emphasizes balance; LONG emphasizes quality + valuation.
- **Position sizing**: Allocations are theoretical; actual portfolio construction should apply Kelly Criterion, portfolio constraints (min/max per position), and user risk budget.
